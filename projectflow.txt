Building Pipeline:
1. Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2. Add src folder along with all components (run them individually).
3. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (without params)
5. Create new dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6. Dvc init then bind dvc repro to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
8. Add params.yaml file
9. Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10. Do “dvc repro” again to test the pipeline along with the params
11. Now git add, commit, push

Experiments with DVC:
1> pip install dvc[live]
2> Add the dvclive code block (mentioned below)
3> Add “dvc exp run” it will create a new dvc.yaml (if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an experiment by DVC)
4> Do “dvc exp show” on terminal to see the experiments or use extension on VSCode (install dvc extension)
5> Do “dvc exp remove {exp-name}” to remove exp (optional) | “dvc exp apply {exp-name}” to reproduce prev exp
6> Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
7> Now git add, commit, push

Adding a remote S3 storage to DVC:
1> Login to AWS console
2> Create an IAM user (straight forward process)
3> Create S3 (enter unique name and create)
4> pip install awscli
5> aws configure
6> dvc remote add -d dvcstore s3://bucketname
7> dvc push -u to store the data you want to keep
